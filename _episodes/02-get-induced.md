The synthetic Open Tree of Life (**synthetic OpenTree** from now on) summarizes information from **1239**
trees from **1184** peer-reviewed and published studies, that have been uploaded to the OpenTree database (the Phylesystem) through a [curator system](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/curator).

Functions from the `rotl` package that interact with the synthetic OpenTree start with `tol_`.

To access general information about the current synthetic OpenTree, we can use the function `tol_about()`. This function requires no argument.

This is nice!

As you can note, the current synthetic OpenTree was created not too long ago, on 2021-06-18 11:13:49.

This is also telling us that there are currently more than **2 million tips** on the synthetic OpenTree.

It is indeed a large tree. So, **_what if we just want a small piece of the whole synthetic OpenTree?_**

Well, now that we have some interesting taxon OTT ids, we can easily do this.


### Getting an induced subtree

The function `tol_induced_subtree()` allows us to get a tree of taxa from different taxonomic ranks.

my_tree <- rotl::tol_induced_subtree(ott_ids = resolved_names$ott_id)

Let's look at the output of `tol_induced_subtree()`.


~~~
my_tree
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

Phylogenetic tree with 5 tips and 4 internal nodes.

Tip labels:
  Delphinidae_ott698406, mrcaott47497ott110766, Felis_ott563165, Spheniscidae_ott494367, Amphibia_ott544595
Node labels:
  Tetrapoda ott229562, Amniota ott229560, mrcaott1548ott4697, mrcaott4697ott6940

Rooted; no branch lengths.
~~~
{: .output}

R is telling us that we have a rooted tree with no branch lengths and 5 tips.
If we check the class of the output, we will verify that it is a **'phylo' object**.


~~~
class(my_tree)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "phylo"
~~~
{: .output}

A 'phylo' object is a data structure that stores the necessary information to build a tree.
There are several functions from different packages to plot trees or 'phylo' objects in R (e.g., [phytools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/phytools/phytools.pdf)). For now, we will use the one from the legendary `ape` package `plot.phylo()`:


~~~
ape::plot.phylo(my_tree, cex = 2) # or just plot(my_tree, cex = 2)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-plot1-1.png" title="plot of chunk plot1" alt="plot of chunk plot1" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

This is cool!

But, why oh why did my _Canis_ disappear? 😢

Well, it did not actually disappear, it was replaced by the label "mrcaott47497ott110766".

We will explain why this happens in the [next section](../03-broken-taxa/index.html).

Now, **_what if you want a piece of the synthetic OpenTree containing all descendants of your taxa of interest?_**

### Getting a subtree of one taxon

We can extract a subtree of all descendants of one taxon at a time using the function `tol_subtree()` and an OTT id of your choosing.

Let's extract a subtree of all amphibians.

First, get its OTT id. It is already stored in our `resolved_names` object:


~~~
amphibia_ott_id <- resolved_names["Amphibia",]$ott_id
~~~
{: .language-r}
Or,  you can run the function `tnrs_match_names()` again if you want.

~~~
amphibia_ott_id <- rotl::tnrs_match_names("amphibians")$ott_id
~~~
{: .language-r}

<br/>

Now, extract the subtree from the synthetic OpenTree using `tol_subtree()`.

~~~
amphibia_subtree <- rotl::tol_subtree(ott_id = resolved_names["Amphibia",]$ott_id)
~~~
{: .language-r}
Let's look at the output:

~~~
amphibia_subtree
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

Phylogenetic tree with 10020 tips and 4669 internal nodes.

Tip labels:
  Odorrana_geminata_ott114, Odorrana_chapaensis_ott214633, Odorrana_grahami_ott43280, Odorrana_margaretae_ott440550, Odorrana_kuangwuensis_ott3618367, Odorrana_junlianensis_ott656728, ...
Node labels:
  Amphibia ott544595, Batrachia ott471197, Anura ott991547, , , , ...

Unrooted; no branch lengths.
~~~
{: .output}
This is a large tree! We will have a hard time plotting it.

<br/>

Now, let's extract a subtree for the genus _Canis_. It should be way smaller!


~~~
subtree <- rotl::tol_subtree(resolved_names["Canis",]$ott_id)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

    mrca = "mrcaott47497ott110766")[/v3/tree_of_life/subtree] Error: node_id was not found (broken taxon).
~~~
{: .error}

## 😱 😱 😱

What does this error mean??

A "broken" taxon error usually happens when phylogenetic information does not match taxonomic information.

For example, extinct lineages are sometimes phylogenetically included within a taxon but are taxonomically excluded, making the taxon appear as paraphyletic.

On the [Open Tree of Life browser](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/ottol@372706), we can still get to the subtree ([check it out here](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/argus/opentree12.3@mrcaott47497ott110766)).

From R, we will need to do something else first. We will get to that on the next episode.
