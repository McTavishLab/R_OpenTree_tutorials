title: Setup
---

For this tutorial, we recommend using RStudio (see [installation instructions](https://opentreeoflife.github.io/SSBworkshop/#setup)), but you can use the R GUI (from a mac) or R from Terminal; feel free to use the tool that works best for you.

From within R, install the packages `rotl`, `ape`, `devtools` and `stringr` with the function `install.packages()`,
and the package `datelife` with the function `install_github()`.

Load them into your workspace with `library()` or `require()`.

When in doubt, follow the code chunk below.

**Hint**:
If you do not want to load the packages, you can call functions specifying their package using two colons and the syntax `package_name::function_name()`.

This implies more typing, but gives more clarity to reproduce the workflow later. So we will use that syntax for this tutorial.

An exception to this, are functions from packages that are "preloaded" --such as `library()` from `base`, or `install.packages()` from `utils`; all these can simply be called by their name.

**Code chunk**:

```{r}
packages <- c("rotl", "ape", "devtools", "stringr")
install.packages(packages)
library(rotl)
library(devtools)
library(stringr)
devtools::install_github("phylotastic/datelife")
devtools::install_github("phylotastic/datelifeplot")
library(datelife)
library(datelifeplot)
```
