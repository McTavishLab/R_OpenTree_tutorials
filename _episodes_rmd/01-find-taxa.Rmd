<!-- ### The Open Tree Taxonomy and its identifiers -->

The [Open Tree of Life Taxonomy](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/about/taxonomy-version/ott3.2) (**OTT** from now on) synthesizes taxonomic information from different sources and assigns each taxon a unique numeric identifier, which we refer to as the **OTT id**. To interact with the OTT (and any other Open Tree of Life services) using R, we will learn how to use the functions from the `rotl` package. If you don't know if you have the package installed, go to [setup](../setup.html) and follow the instructions there.

To deal with synonyms and scientific name misspellings, the Open Tree Taxonomy uses
the [Taxonomic Name Resolution Service](http://tnrs.iplantcollaborative.org/) (**TNRS**
from now on), that allows linking scientific names to a unique OTT id, while dealing
with misspellings, synonyms and scientific name variants. The functions from `rotl` that interact
with OTT's TNRS start with "tnrs_".

<br/>

### Getting OTT ids for a taxon

To get OTT ids for a taxon or set of taxa we will use the function `tnrs_match_names()`.
This function takes a character vector of one or more scientific names as main argument.

> ## Hands on! Running TNRS
>
> Do a `tnrs_match_names()` run for the amphibians (Amphibia). Save the output to an object named `resolved_name`.
>
> You can try different misspellings and synonyms of your taxon to see TNRS in action.

>
> ```{r, eval = TRUE}
>
> resolved_name <- rotl::tnrs_match_names(names = "amphibians")
> resolved_name
> ```
>

Ok, we were able to run the function `tnrs_match_names` successfully. Now, let's explore the structure of the output.

<br/>

### The 'match_names' object

As we can tell from the data printed to screen, the output of the `tnrs_match_names` function is some sort of a data table. In R (and all object-oriented programmming languages), defined data structures called [**classes**](https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/object-class-introduction/) are assigned to objects. This makes data manipulation and usage of objects across different functions much easier.
Redundantly, a class is defined as a data structure that is the same among all objects that belong to the same class. However, we can do more to understadn the structure of any class,
To get the name of the class of the `tnrs_match_names()` output, we will use the function `class`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
class(resolved_name)
```

<br/>

As you can see, an object can belong to one or more classes.

Indeed, R is telling us that the output of `tnrs_match_names()` is a data frame (a type of table) and a **'match_names' object**, which is in turn a data frame with exactly `r ncol(resolved_name)` named columns: `search_string`, `unique_name`, `approximate_match`, `ott_id`, `is_synonym`, `flags`, and `number_matches`.
<!-- `r paste0("**", colnames(resolved_name)[-7], "**")`, and `r paste0("**", colnames(resolved_name)[7], "**")`. -->

Next we will explore the kinds of data that are stored in each of the columns of a 'match_names' object.

<br/>

### Kinds of data stored in a 'match_names' object

You should have a good idea by now of what type of data is stored in the `ott_ids` column.

Can you guess what type of data is displayed in the column `search_string` and `unique_name`?

How about `is_synonym`?

The column `approximate_match` tells us whether the unique name was inferred from the search string using approximate matching (TRUE) or not (FALSE).

<!-- The column `number_matches` tells us how many -->

Finally, the `flags` column tells us if our unique name has been flagged in the OTT
(TRUE) or not (FALSE). It also indicates the type of flag associated to the taxon. Flags are markers that indicate if the taxon in question is problematic and should be included in further analyses of the Open Tree workflow. You can read more about flags in the [Open Tree wiki](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/reference-taxonomy/wiki/Taxon-flags).

Now we know what kind of data is retrieved by the `tnrs_match_names()` function. Pretty cool!

### Getting OTT ids for multiple taxon names at a time

Now that we know about classes and the data structure of the `tnrs_match_names` output, we will learn how to use the tnrs_match_names function for multiple taxa.
In this case, you will have to create a character vector with your taxon names and use it as input for `tnrs_match_names`:

<br/>

>
> Do a `tnrs_match_names()` run for the amphibians (Amphibia), the genus of the dog (_Canis_),
> the genus of the cat (_Felis_), the family of dolphins (Delphinidae), and the class

>

> resolved_names
> ```
>
{: .challenge}

### `r emo::ji("exclamation_mark")`

You should get a matched named for all the taxa in this example. If you do not get a match for all your taxa, and you get an unexpected warning message, it means that the `tnrs_match_names` function might not be working as expected. Please refer to Pro tip 1.2 below for alternative ways to get OTT ids for multiple taxa at a time using `tnrs_match_names`.

Finally, we are going to learn how to extract specific pieces of data from a `match_names` object to use in other functions and workflows.

<br/>

> >
> > If you get a warning message saying that any of your taxon names "are not matched", it means that the `tnrs_match_names` function is not implementig TNRS for inputs with more than one name. This is an unexpected behaviour. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ropensci/rotl/issues/134) for updates.

### Extracting data from a 'match_names' object

It is easy to access elements from a 'match_names' object using regular indexing.
For example, using the column number, we can extract all elements from a certain column.
Let's extract all data from the second column:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
resolved_names[,2]
```
We can also use the name of the column so we do not have to remember its position:
```{r, eval = TRUE}
resolved_names[,"unique_name"]
```
Because it is a 'data.frame', we can also access the values of any column by using
the "$" and the column name to index it, like this:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
resolved_names$unique_name
```

The 'match_names' object has a relatively simple structure that is easy to explore and mine.
We will see later that the outputs of other `rotl` functions are more complicated
and accessing their elements requires a lot of hacking. Fortunately, the `rotl` creators have
added some functions that allow interacting with these complicated outputs.
The functions `unique_name()`, `ott_id()`, and `flags()` extract values from the
respective columns of a 'match_names' object, in the form of a list instead of a vector.
To extract data from the other columns there are no specialized functions, so you will have to index.

<br/>

There are no specialized functions to extract values from a row of a 'match_names' object, so we have to do some indexing.
You can get values from all columns of one row:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
resolved_names[1,]
```

Or get just one specific value from a certain column, using the column name:
```{r, eval = TRUE}
resolved_names[1,"unique_name"]
```
Or using the column position:
```{r, eval = TRUE}
resolved_names[1,2]
```
<br/>
There we go! Now we know how to get OTT ids from a bunch of taxa of interest. Let's see what we can do with these on the next section.

### Taxonomic contexts and updating a 'match_names' object

Running a TNRS match can take some time, so if you just want to update a few elements from your 'match_names' object, you can use the functions `inspect()` and `update()`.

The _Mus_ example is fixed.

## **Hack!**

Put together two 'match_names' objects with `c()` or `rbind()`
