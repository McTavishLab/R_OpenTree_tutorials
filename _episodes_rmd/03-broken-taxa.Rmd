We say that a taxon is _"broken"_ when its OTT id is not assigned to any node in the OpenTree synthetic tree.
As mentioned before, this happens when the OTT id belongs to a taxon that is not monophyletic in the current version of the synthetic OpenTree.
This is the reason why we get an error when we try to get an OpenTree synthetic subtree including the OTT id of the genus _Canis_ --it is **not monophyletic** in the tree.


There is a way to find out that a group is "broken" before trying to get the subtree and getting an error.
```{r, eval = TRUE, warning= FALSE, error = TRUE}
rotl::is_in_tree(resolved_names["Canis",]$ott_id)
```

Indeed, our _Canis_ is **not** in the synthetic OpenTree. To extract a subtree of a "broken" taxon, we have some options. But we will focus on one.

### Getting the MRCA of a taxon

The function `tol_node_info()` gets for you all relevant information of the node that is the ancestor or MRCA of a taxon. That also includes the actual node id.
```{r, eval = TRUE, warning= FALSE, error = TRUE}
canis_node_info <- rotl::tol_node_info(resolved_names["Canis",]$ott_id)
canis_node_info
```
Let's explore the class of the output.

```{r, eval = TRUE, warning= FALSE, error = TRUE}
class(canis_node_info)
```
<br/>
<br/>

So we have an object of class 'list' and 'tol_node'. When we printed it, we got some
information. But we do not know how much information might not be "printed" to screen.

<br/>

Let's use the functions `str()` or `ls()` to check out the data strcture of our 'tol_node' object.

```{r, eval = TRUE, warning= FALSE, error = TRUE}
str(canis_node_info)
```

This is telling us that `tol_node_info()` extracted 8 different pieces of information from my node.
Right now we are only interested in the node id. Where do you think we can find it?

The node that contains _Canis_ is **`r canis_node_info$node_id`**.

### Getting a subtree using a node id instead of the taxon OTT id

Now that we have a node id, we can use it to get a subtree with `tol_subtree()`, using the argument `node_id`.

```{r, eval = TRUE, results= 'hold', warning= FALSE, error = TRUE}
canis_node_subtree <- rotl::tol_subtree(node_id = canis_node_id)
canis_node_subtree
```
```{r, eval = TRUE, results= 'asis', warning= FALSE, error = TRUE, fig.height = 20}
ape::plot.phylo(canis_node_subtree, cex = 1.2)
```

Nice! We got a subtree of 85 tips, containing all descendants from the node that also contains _Canis_.

If you explore the taxon names at the tip, you will notice that this includes species assigned to genera other than _Canis_.

Now, what if I want a subtree of certain taxonomic ranks withing my group? Go to the next episode and find out how you can do this!
